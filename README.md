# EasyMotion

This extension implements a simplified version of the [EasyMotion plugin for Vim](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion).

Please note that this is an extremely simple implementation that I developed for myself as the others that I found on the marketplace did not suit my needs.  I'll likely be adding to it as I use it, but feel free to request additional features on the issues page or submit pull requests.

## Usage

Create a keybinding for the `vscode-easymotion.easyMotionJump` command.  This will make the available jump points visible.  You can then press the appropriate key combination to jump to the desired position.
